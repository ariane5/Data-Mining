# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS BASED ON MOVIE REVIEWS


THE DATASET 
the neg/ contains Movie reviews with negative polarity
the pos/ contains Movie reviews with positive polarity


THE IMPLEMENTATION IS DIVIDED INTO THREE CODES 

1. sentiment_lem.py 
 It use the lemmatizer preprocessing

2. sentiment_stem.py 
It use the stemming preprocessing 

3. sentiment_stop.py 
 IT uses stopwords only  


 The purpose of the  implementation is to build two classifiers SVM  and Knaive Bayes ,
 to learn about their accuracy w.r.t  tree forms of preprocessing :
 stop words , stopword + lemmatization ,stopword +stemming  
 to automatically classify a movie review to either positif or negatif class 
 according to the classifiers
